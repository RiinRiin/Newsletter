# Newsletter API-Integration
Simple Email Sign-up Landing Page using Express and Mailchimp API.
**EDIT:*** Mailchimp disabled my API-Key due to security concern and is no longer connected. Everything else is still functional. 

## Learning Objectives
* ***API*** integration through ***Express*** using ***Node.js***
* Learn to deploy through ***Heroku***

Through this project I was able to gain knowledge of API integration as well as deploying a fully functioning web app on heroku.
